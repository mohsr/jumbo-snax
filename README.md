# jumbo-snax

A command line tool that lets you view the Tufts dining hall menus
and search for your favorite foods!

## Usage

Run the program with Python2 for an interactive interface. Some of
the features do not work and need to be implemented, and the program
itself needs to be re-written, so I make not guarantees at the moment
about everything working fine.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to [Derick Yang's Tufts dining data 
API](https://github.com/dyang108/diningdata)
that made this possible, and to my friend Steven's [Alexa skill to
check for tendies](https://github.com/StevieSong/TuftsDining) that
inspired me to make this.
