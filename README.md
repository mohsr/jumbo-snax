A program that lets you view the Tufts dining hall menus and search for
your favorite foods!

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to Derick Yang's Tufts dining data API, found at
https://github.com/dyang108/diningdata, that made this all possible, and to
my friend Steven Song's Alexa skill to check for tendies, found at
https://github.com/StevieSong/TuftsDining, that inspired me to make this.
